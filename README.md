# Unfinished Features:
 - Missing the riddle puzzle involving picking up letter blocks and stacking them to spell the answer to a riddle.

# Future Improvements:
When I have to I plan to finish the intended puzzle for the last room. I could also work on randomizing puzzle solutions. I would also like to try to devise more rooms for other puzzles. I had thoughts of making a water physics based puzzle before shifting to the 3D maze. I also would like to try some form of perspective puzzle where the solution can only be figured out by viewing things at specific angles.
